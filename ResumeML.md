**Project Experience:**

<p style="text-align:left;">Machine Learning SMS Classification Project (NLTK, Numpy, Panda)<span style="float:right;">08/2023 - 09/2023</span></p>

> 1. Text preprocessing using nltk and other feature extraction.
> 2. Improve prediction accuracy by handling unbalanced samples using SMOTE, adjusting class weights, Bagging, etc.;
> 3. Train multiple models (SVM, Bayes, Linear/Logistic Regression, Random Forest) using cross-validation to select parameters, getting a balanced accuracy of 0.89;

<p style="text-align:left;">Wind Turbine Blade Defect Detection System (YOLO, OpenCV, Pytorch, PyQt)<span style="float:right;">12/2022 - 05/2023</span></p>

> 1. Collection of real data and labeling;
> 2. Sample enhancement using image fusion algorithm based on torch to process images;
> 3. Detection of defects based on the YOLOv5;
> 4. Designing the system software interface and deploying the model using Qt designer;

<p style="text-align:left;">Universal External Preprocessing System for Ultrasonic Machines (CNN, OpenCV, matchTemplate, OCR, PyQt)<span style="float:right;">05/2020 - 05/2021</span></p>

> 1. Developed an intelligent ultrasonic image preprocessing system in cooperation with Harbin Medical University.
